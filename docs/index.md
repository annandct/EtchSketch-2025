## Behold! The Etch a Sketch!!

This genius experimental paradigm was stumbled upon by visiting scholar Ed Baggs. Imagine (said he) - if we were to track how a person learned to use such a device. The theories we could test!

Colin and Francis flung themselves to the task. And in short order a (research purpose only not for commerical use) experimental device called the Etch-Sketch was created. 


## Results

Surprisingly - the Etch a Sketch led to a few quality conference presentations and publications in Human Movement Science. 

## Resources

This site was put together by Colin T. Annand (see his info in the staff section). He's held onto the experimental files for this experiment for quite a while, and is chuffed to see some positive momentum around the project. 

## Goals

Keep the circle spinning.
