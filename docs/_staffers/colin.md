Colin was flung out of the academic vortex by pandemic perturbations in 2021. With PhD firmly grasped, he's plyed his hand at stats, data-science, welding, UI/UX design, high performance coaching and hustling unsuspecting chess players. With a plethora of hobbies firmly established he felt safe enough to maintain employment without anything that could be considered serious commitment. He concurrently consults and teaches online courses for graduate and researchers to improve stats, coding, and research skills.
