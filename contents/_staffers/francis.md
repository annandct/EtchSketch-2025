Francis received his BA in Psychology in 2015 from the University of Connecticut with a research focus on human perceptual-motor behavior. He then enrolled in the Experimental Psychology doctoral program at the University of Cincinnati where he received his MA in 2018 and PhD in 2020 studying human perceptual-motor behavior from the perspectives of ecological psychology, complex dynamical systems, and neuromechanics. After graduating he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago studying neurostimulation techniques to repair corticospinal connections after spinal cord injury. His research is broadly centered on the neuromechanical control of human movement. So far, his research has focused on fine motor skill and motor coordination, in particular manual dexterity, in both healthy individuals and those with motor pathology. He joined the Human Agility Lab in April 2022 to continue studying human movement from interdisciplinary behavioral and neuromechanical approaches.
